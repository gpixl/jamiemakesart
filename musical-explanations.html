    Hoo boy. This song is sort of about past events I feel super complex about. The song itself is pretty simple, although a little unique - it's me doing some keyboard sprinkly sounds live on my yamaha keyboard, recorded through my phone, filtered a bunch - so you can hear realistic, grounded, yet... dreamlike? sounds, like the physical sound of my fingers on my keyboard. later on in the song you can hear some bass and kick drums, to sorta amp up the intensity

    The "past events I feel super complex about"? Well there's a bunch of them... a lotta stuff from 2022, like me meeting my at the time online partner irl (my feelings on that are really mixed, due to the whole breakup.. I'm glad it happened in the moment, but it makes me feel really strange, somewhat uncomfortable, but also nostalgic at the same time, even though it really wasnt that long ago... its not an event im gonna be forgetting, thats for sure)
      
    The song also tries to kinda capture that vibe of sitting in your car, taking it all in, moments after something happened. I remember just looking at distant lights and whatnot out a car window, driving back to my relatives' house, after having met them for the first time IRL... it sure was a feeling!

    <a class="thoughttitle" href="https://greenpixel.bandcamp.com/track/a-whisper-in-your-ear">A Whisper in Your Ear</a>
      
    This one was directly inspired by a specific moment from the summer camp I went to in 2023.
    Basically, there's this thing that happens on the last day, called "whispering angels". The way it works is:
      
About half the people sit down, and half the people stand up (you can sit down or stand up whenever you want.) The people standing up can whisper positive things in anyone's ear!
I forgot exactly what it was, but I remember someone (a really cool counselor at the camp that I liked a lot) saying something along the lines of... You're in a hard spot right now, but know that you're not alone, and you'll figure it all out eventually. (Referring to me figuring out my gender identity and who I am... considering they've been through it too.)

It made me cry. I don't usually cry to sad things - usually I cry because I'm overwhelmed with other emotions

So this song is sort of a tribute to that moment. It has some whispering lyrics I recorded through my headphones' crappy microphone, which I did write out in advance, and yes, they do rhyme! Although, somewhat intentionally, you can't hear what I'm saying. It sort of feels distant, like my memory of the moment I'm trying to capture... But hopefully, the emotion still sticks.

    <a class="thoughttitle" href="https://greenpixel.bandcamp.com/track/start-anew-2">Start Anew</a>

      This song's pretty straightforward in its meaning! I made it pretty much on the new year, start of 2023. I didn't put in a ton of effort to connect the vibe of the song to the meaning behind it, but honestly, a lot of the time, the vibe of the song influences the meaning and kinda puts a new context to the original message I was trying to convey haha

      So for this one, it sorta gives off the vibe of putting stuff behind you, whether it's something you're nostalgic for, or something that's kinda haunting you, and... putting it in the past. We're starting Anew regardless.

    <a class="thoughttitle" href="https://greenpixel.bandcamp.com/track/spark">Spark</a>

I don't really know how many people have noticed, but this song is pretty much a direct parallel to Start Anew. It reuses a couple of instrumental and melod motifs, but kinda puts them in a more happy tone. The whole album that this song was from was originally dedicated to my relationship with my (at the time) partner, but well... as that's gone away, I've sorta shifted my whole perspective on the album. It's not really about them specifically, it's about relationships in general! (not just romantic ones/partner ones!)

  Spark is sorta about the spark you sometimes get when like... really truly connecting with someone. In Start Anew, it's more general, but with this, the song's more about first impressions and stuff, starting anew with a new friend, partner, or any kind of person in your life.
