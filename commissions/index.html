      <p><b>Hi! I do art and music commissions :)</b>
      
      You can reach me on Discord (pickledoodles), Email (<a class="commlink" href="mailto:greenpixel16@gmail.com">greenpixel16@gmail.com</a>), Twitter (<a class="commlink" href="https://twitter.com/Greenpixel10">@Greenpixel10</a>), via Morse Code (<a class="commlink" href="https://www.bool.chat/">bool.chat</a>), or anywhere else you know me! (I'm most active on Discord)
      
      For payment, Ko-Fi works best (<a class="commlink" href="https://ko-fi.com/pickledoodlez">ko-fi.com/pickledoodlez</a>) - if it doesn't work for you, you can pay me via Paypal - I can send it to you once we start chatting.
     
      After I finish a commission for you, feel free to show me what you used it for! I'd love to see.</p>
      <bbr></bbr>

      References help! A lot! Also, a super duper simple sketch (even if you're not an artist) can help me get an idea of what you want visually.
      
      I'm not an expert! The main thing I struggle with is realistic anatomy at the moment, so keep that in mind if you want me to draw a full human character.
        
      I won't draw anything NSFW or Suggestive!
        
      I might back down from a commission (<i>before the payment</i>), if it's clearly too challenging for me, or if the topic of the drawing makes me uncomfortable.
      
      Credit's appreciated if you use my art, and also, please don't do anything malicious with my art!

        For <b>music</b>:
      </h2>
      <b>A song is generally between</b> <text class="money">$15</text> <b>and</b> <text class="money">$30</text>
      <br>
      <text style="color: #c4c3db; font-weight: bold;">It depends on how hard it'll be for me to make. For example:</text>
      <p>
      A song that's pretty close to my normal musical style and instruments that I use will be on the cheaper price, closer to $15. Length usually doesnt matter too much for me, as long as its generally under 5 minutes long. Listen to some of my music on bandcamp to get an idea of the styles I can do relatively easily!
      
      A song that's complex, has a very specific style you want me to replicate (for example, specific instruments I don't normally use), takes a long time to make, or requires me to do a lot of revisions, will probably be on the more pricey side, closer to $30.

      <p>
      Do note that I'm not an expert! I don't have a ton of knowledge in music theory and I'm pretty limited in terms of instruments and software - so <i>generally</i>, you should commission me for music if you like my style :]
      
      If a song is <i>too</i> hard for me to make, I might back out of it (which I'll decide before the payment.)
