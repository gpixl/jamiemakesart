      Thoughts about my songs!

    <a class="thoughttitle" href="https://greenpixel.bandcamp.com/track/a-whisper-in-your-ear">A Whisper in Your Ear</a>
      
    This one was directly inspired by a specific moment from the summer camp I went to in 2023.
    Basically, there's this thing that happens on the last day, called "whispering angels". The way it works is:
      
About half the people sit down, and half the people stand up (you can sit down or stand up whenever you want.) The people standing up can whisper positive things in anyone's ear!
I forgot exactly what it was, but I remember someone (a really cool counselor at the camp that I liked a lot) saying something along the lines of... You're in a hard spot right now, but know that you're not alone, and you'll figure it all out eventually. (Referring to me figuring out my gender identity and who I am... considering they've been through it too.)

It made me cry. I don't usually cry to sad things - usually I cry because I'm overwhelmed with other emotions

So this song is sort of a tribute to that moment. It has some whispering lyrics I recorded through my headphones' crappy microphone, which I did write out in advance, and yes, they do rhyme! Although, somewhat intentionally, you can't hear what I'm saying. It sort of feels distant, like my memory of the moment I'm trying to capture... But hopefully, the emotion still sticks.

    <a class="thoughttitle" href="https://greenpixel.bandcamp.com/track/start-anew-2">Start Anew</a>

      I made this song on the new year, at the start of 2023
      I meant to sorta give off the vibe of putting stuff behind you, whether it's something you're nostalgic for, or something that's kinda haunting you. Just starting anew regardless
    </p>
      
    <p class="thought">
    <a class="thoughttitle" href="https://greenpixel.bandcamp.com/track/spark">Spark</a>

I don't really know how many people have noticed, it's kind of a parallel to Start Anew. It reuses a couple of instrumental and melodic motifs, but kinda puts them in a more happy tone.

  Spark is sorta about the spark you sometimes get when like... really truly connecting with someone. In Start Anew, it's more general, but with this, the song's more about first impressions and stuff, starting anew with a new friend, partner, or any kind of person in your life.

    <a class="thoughttitle" href="https://greenpixel.bandcamp.com/track/lets-go-outside">Let's Go Outside</a>
Every so often I get the chance to walk around my little town at night... And it gives me an emotion I can't really describe easily

I'm honestly really lucky to live somewhere thats pretty at night, with all the streetlights lighting up like fireflies (and I'm also lucky to be in a place that's fairly safe to walk around at night)

(Enjoy this very blurry image with plenty of lens flares... also dont somehow doxx me)

This song is sort of a tribute to those moments, where I get out and go outside and get to walk around a silent town with glowing lights and cold air against my skin, as I hold myself close and hope that the night never ends.

    <a class="thoughttitle" href="https://greenpixel.bandcamp.com/track/piecing-it-together">Piecing It Together</a>
I've done a lot of piecing myself together over the past year and a half. It gets complicated and weird... but also fills me with drive, finally putting together those pieces of who I really am.
Honestly, it kind of blends with <i>Let's Go Outside</i> in a way... Being outside and having some time to myself to figure out what I am connects to this a lot, but this is meant to have a more active, realized feel to it.
I do hope I didn't convey any sad feelings in the song, because the song is really about figuring confusing things out, and piecing myself together.
    </p>
      
    <p class="thought">
    <a class="thoughttitle" href="https://greenpixel.bandcamp.com/track/taking-it-in-2">Taking it in</a>
This song is like <i>Let's Go Outside</i> or <i>Piecing It Together</i> in terms of emotion... but instead of walking around a silent town, I'm looking out a car window, watching lights race past me, looking at distant silhouettes, getting glimpses of the world, and taking it all in. It's really the kind of thing you have to let yourself experience.
    </p>
      
    <p class="thought">
    <a class="thoughttitle" href="https://greenpixel.bandcamp.com/track/blurry">Blurry</a>
Although I would've liked to capture the vibes more, this song sorta tries to capture what it feels like when everything feels blurry, or maybe you've just woken up from a nap. You're not quite adjusted to everything that's going on, and, in cases, it still keeps racing by.

    <a class="thoughttitle" href="https://greenpixel.bandcamp.com/track/breaking-loose">Breaking Loose</a>
I feel like this song is almost a fantasy... but not quite. 

I'd love to be able to just break loose from my environment (which means, to a bit of an extent, my family...) and run as far as I can and be myself.

I might get lost though. It's scary. That's what this song tries to convey. Running and running and realizing you really have no idea where you're going or what you're doing, but never wanting to go back. The drive to break loose persists anyways.
    </p>
      
    <p class="thought">
    <a class="thoughttitle" href="https://greenpixel.bandcamp.com/track/pushing-on">Pushing On</a>
This song is actually a sort of remix or recreation of one of my older songs, <i><a class="commlink" style="text-decoration: underline" href="https://soundcloud.com/greenpixel-748207841/keep-pushing-on">Keep Pushing On.</a></i> The new name for the song is more in-line with all the other songs in <i>Chasing Myself</i> (actions, like <i>Breaking Loose</i>).

Although the original isn't quite as high quality as my current stuff, I feel like there's something unique about the original that isn't there in the new version (but also vice versa for the new version!), so I think each version has something of its own.

The song is about... determination I guess? Just the drive to keep pushing on for when things get better. It's not easy.

Hopefully the song is a bop no matter what the meaning is :)
    </p>

    <a class="thoughttitle" href="https://greenpixel.bandcamp.com/track/lets-go-back-2">Let's Go Back</a>
It's pretty easy to recognize, when looking at the album's song names, that it sort of parallels <i>Let's Go Outside</i>. It has a sort of scared, cold feeling, and at the end you can even hear me breathing.
The main ambient-ish layer of the song is me playing an electric piano live, put through some filters and reversed, so you can hear the raw sounds of the keys clicking.

I guess this sort of reframes the whole 'being outside and aware and alive' feeling in sort of a scared, withdrawn vibe. Maybe you're going home after something bad happened, and you look at the distant lights and it feels like they're the only things that understand you.
